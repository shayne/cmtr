# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/cmtr/`: Primary Python package; includes the CLI entry point (`cmtr:main`).
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration (uv).
- `uv.lock`: Locked dependency set generated by uv.
- `mise.toml`: Tool versions and task shortcuts.
- `README.md`: User-facing documentation (currently minimal).
- `LICENSE`: MIT license.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use mise for tool management and uv for environment execution.
- `mise install`: Install tool versions (Python via mise).
- `mise run install`: Create/update the uv environment (`uv sync`).
- `mise run run`: Run the CLI in the project environment (`uv run cmtr`).

Direct uv equivalents:
- `uv sync`: Resolve and install dependencies into the uv environment.
- `uv run cmtr`: Execute the CLI in the uv environment.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: Python (target 3.14.2+; see `.python-version`).
- Indentation: 4 spaces; no tabs.
- Naming: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes.
- Formatting/linting: no tooling configured yet; keep edits minimal and readable.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test framework is set up and there is no `tests/` directory.
- If adding tests, prefer `pytest` with `tests/test_*.py` naming.
- Run tests with `uv run pytest` once configured.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use a Conventional Commits style (`feat:`, `chore:`). Follow the same prefix pattern for new commits.
- PRs should include: a concise summary, how to verify (commands/output), and linked issue/context if applicable.

## Configuration & Tooling Tips
- Update `pyproject.toml` when adding dependencies or CLI entry points.
- Keep `mise.toml` in sync with required tool versions and tasks.
- Regenerate `uv.lock` via `uv sync` when dependencies change.
